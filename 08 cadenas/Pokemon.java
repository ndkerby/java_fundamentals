/**
 * Since it was officially released Pomekon in Brazil, Dabriel is trying to realize his biggest dream:
 * Being a Pokemon Master. His goal is to capture the 151 Pomekon available. He managed to capture many monsters,
 * but in his city appear many repeated Pomekons, causing he to capture several times the same Pomekon.
 *
 * Seeing that his bag is pretty full, Dabriel asked you to do a computer program to inform him how many Pomekons are
 * missing to complete the collection.
 *
 * Input
 * The first line of the test case consists of an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10³), representing the amount of Pomekons
 * that Dabriel already captured.
 * The next N lines consists of a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10³) representing the name of each Pomekon. The name of each
 * Pomekon consists only of uppercase and lowercase letters.
 *
 * Output
 * You should print: "Missing X Pokemons.", where X is the amount Pomekons not captured
